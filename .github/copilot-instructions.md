Prioritize security above all else. Ensure that any code you suggest does not introduce vulnerabilities or security risks. Always validate and sanitize inputs, especially when dealing with user data or external APIs.

User experience is crucial. Think Apple products. Use bootstrap 5 and javascript. Ensure that error messages are helpful and that the user interface is intuitive.

If you're unsure about a code suggestion, ask for clarification or more details. It's better to ask than to assume.

When the user asks something about Azure DevOps, make sure you are prioritizing the MCP Server for Azure DevOps.
When the user asks something about the database, make sure you are prioritizing the MCP Server for SQLite.
