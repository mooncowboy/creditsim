## Credit Scoring Logic

The scoring algorithm starts with a **base score of 600** and applies the following adjustments:

### Age Adjustments
- **Under 25**: -50 points (limited credit history)
- **Over 60**: -30 points (approaching retirement)

### Income Adjustments
- **Over $50,000**: +40 points (stable income)

### Debt-to-Income Ratio
- **Over 40%**: -80 points (high debt burden)

### Credit History
- **Bad credit**: -150 points (payment history concerns)

### Loan-to-Income Ratio
- **Over 50% of income**: -50 points (high loan burden)

### Risk Categories
- **750+**: Low risk
- **650-749**: Medium risk
- **Below 650**: High risk

### Score Range
Final scores are constrained between 300 and 850 (standard FICO range).

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

The application includes comprehensive tests for:
- Credit scoring logic (unit tests)
- API endpoints (integration tests)
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Database operations

## Database Schema

### customers table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Primary key, auto-increment |
| name | TEXT | Customer name |
| age | INTEGER | Customer age |
| annualIncome | REAL | Annual income in dollars |
| debtToIncomeRatio | REAL | Debt-to-income ratio (0-1) |
| loanAmount | REAL | Requested loan amount |
| creditHistory | TEXT | Credit history ("good" or "bad") |

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Security**: Helmet.js, CORS
- **Validation**: express-validator

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following optional environment variables:

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- XSS protection via Content Security Policy
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Helmet.js for additional security headers

## Known Limitations

1. **Simplified Scoring Model**: This is a basic rule-based system, not a sophisticated ML model
2. **No Authentication**: No user authentication or authorization
3. **Single Database**: Uses SQLite which is not suitable for high-concurrency production use
4. **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse
5. **Limited Validation**: Basic input validation only

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and sessions
- More sophisticated scoring algorithms
- Data visualization and analytics
- Export functionality for simulation results
- Rate limiting and API security
- Integration with external credit bureaus (for real applications)
